# counting-paths-coding-challenge

> Counting paths is a coding challenge where you navigate a grid, counting unique ways to reach the destination. You'll tackle obstacles, aiming to devise an efficient algorithm—usually through recursion or dynamic programming—to calculate valid paths. It's a digital maze-solving exercise that hones your problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
